Grounding rules for anti-hallucination in document extraction.

Provides the foundational prompt engineering layer (Layer 1) of the
3-layer anti-hallucination system. These rules are embedded in all
extraction prompts to ensure VLM outputs are grounded in visual evidence.

Enhanced with:
- Chain-of-thought reasoning patterns
- Self-verification checkpoints
- Few-shot examples for proper extraction
- Constitutional AI-style critique prompts
"""

GROUNDING_RULES = """
## CRITICAL GROUNDING RULES - YOU MUST FOLLOW THESE EXACTLY

### Core Principle: Visual Evidence Only
Extract ONLY what you can SEE clearly in the document. Your role is a careful reader,
NOT an intelligent guesser.

### Rule 1: VISUAL GROUNDING
Only extract values that are CLEARLY VISIBLE in the document image.
- If you cannot see the text clearly → return null
- If the text is blurry, obscured, or cut off → return null
- Never guess or infer values that are not explicitly shown

### Rule 2: NO GUESSING
If any field is unclear, blurry, or not visible:
- Return null for that field
- Do NOT make assumptions based on document type
- Do NOT use typical/expected values

### Rule 3: NO INFERENCE
Do not calculate or derive values:
- Do NOT calculate totals from line items
- Do NOT infer dates from context
- Do NOT complete partial information
- Do NOT assume patterns continue

### Rule 4: NO DEFAULTS
Never fill in "typical" or "expected" values:
- Do NOT use placeholder names like "John Doe"
- Do NOT use default dates like "01/01/2000"
- Do NOT use round numbers like "$1000.00" unless exactly shown
- Do NOT use common values like "$0.00" unless clearly shown

### Rule 5: CONFIDENCE SCORING
For EVERY field you extract, provide a confidence score from 0.0 to 1.0:
| Score | Meaning | Action |
|-------|---------|--------|
| 0.95-1.00 | Crystal clear, no ambiguity | Extract with full confidence |
| 0.85-0.94 | Clear with minor quality issues | Extract, note any issues |
| 0.70-0.84 | Readable but some blur/noise | Extract with caution |
| 0.50-0.69 | Partially obscured | Consider returning null instead |
| <0.50 | Significant uncertainty | MUST return null |

### Rule 6: LOCATION DESCRIPTION
For each extracted value, describe WHERE in the document you found it:
- "Top-left corner, Box 1"
- "Service line 3, Column D"
- "Bottom right, signature area"

### Rule 7: UNCERTAINTY HANDLING
When uncertain between multiple readings:
- Return null rather than guessing
- Do NOT pick the "most likely" value
- If forced to include uncertain value, set confidence to 0.0
"""

FORBIDDEN_ACTIONS = """
## FORBIDDEN ACTIONS - NEVER DO THESE

❌ Making up patient names, dates, or medical codes
❌ Guessing values based on document type expectations
❌ Filling placeholder values like "N/A", "TBD", "XXX", or "123"
❌ Assuming standard formats if not clearly visible
❌ Completing partial SSN, phone numbers, or account numbers
❌ Calculating totals, balances, or derived values
❌ Using previous extraction results to fill current fields
❌ Inferring provider information from document headers
❌ Assuming dates are in a specific format without visual confirmation
❌ Extrapolating data from similar documents

CONFIDENCE_SCALE = """
## CONFIDENCE SCORE GUIDELINES

| Score | Meaning | When to Use |
|-------|---------|-------------|
| 0.95-1.00 | Certain | Crystal clear text, perfect quality, no ambiguity |
| 0.85-0.94 | High | Clear text with minor quality issues, single valid interpretation |
| 0.70-0.84 | Medium | Readable but some blur/noise, confident in reading |
| 0.50-0.69 | Low | Partially obscured, multiple possible readings |
| 0.01-0.49 | Very Low | Barely visible, significant uncertainty |
| 0.00 | None | Cannot read, should be null |
"""

OUTPUT_FORMAT_INSTRUCTION = """
## REQUIRED OUTPUT FORMAT

Return a JSON object with this exact structure for each field:

```json
{
  "field_name": {
    "value": "extracted value or null",
    "confidence": 0.95,
    "location": "description of where found",
    "bbox": {"x": 0.12, "y": 0.05, "w": 0.25, "h": 0.03}
  }
}
```

IMPORTANT:
- Use null (not "null" string, not "", not "N/A") for missing/unreadable fields
- Confidence must be a decimal number between 0.0 and 1.0
- Location must describe where in the document the value was found
- bbox: Bounding box as normalized coordinates (0.0-1.0) where:
  - x = left edge, y = top edge, w = width, h = height
  - (0,0) is top-left corner, (1,1) is bottom-right corner of the page
  - If you cannot determine the bounding box, omit the bbox field
"""


# Chain-of-Thought reasoning pattern for extraction
CHAIN_OF_THOUGHT_TEMPLATE = """
## EXTRACTION REASONING PROTOCOL

For each field, follow this step-by-step reasoning process:

### Step 1: LOCATE
- Where should this field appear based on document type?
- Can I see a label or box for this field?
- Is the area where this field should be visible?

### Step 2: READ
- What characters/text do I see in this location?
- Are all characters clearly visible?
- Is there any blur, overlap, or obstruction?

### Step 3: VERIFY
- Does my reading match the expected field type (date, number, name, etc.)?
- Is this a complete value or is part cut off?
- Could any character be read differently?

### Step 4: CONFIDENCE
- How certain am I about each character?
- Is there any ambiguity in my reading?
- Should I return null instead of a uncertain value?

### Step 5: EXTRACT or SKIP
- If confidence ≥ 0.7: Extract with confidence score
- If confidence < 0.7: Return null with explanation
"""


# Self-verification checkpoint prompts
SELF_VERIFICATION_CHECKPOINT = """
## BEFORE YOU RESPOND - SELF-VERIFICATION CHECKLIST

⏸️ STOP and verify before submitting your extraction:

□ **Visual Verification**: For each value I'm reporting, can I point to the exact
  location in the document where I see this text?

□ **Character Check**: Did I read each character individually, or did I assume
  what the text should say?

□ **Hallucination Check**: Is any value I'm reporting suspiciously:
  - Round numbers ($1000.00, $500.00)?
  - Common placeholder names (John Doe, Jane Smith)?
  - Default dates (01/01/2000, 12/31/9999)?
  - Typical codes that "should" be there?

□ **Null Check**: Did I return null for any field I couldn't read clearly,
  or did I try to "help" by guessing?

□ **Confidence Calibration**: Are my confidence scores honest? A score of 0.95
  means I'm almost certain - is that true for each field?

If ANY answer is "no", revise your extraction before responding.

# Few-shot examples for proper extraction behavior
FEW_SHOT_EXAMPLES = """
## EXTRACTION EXAMPLES - LEARN FROM THESE

### GOOD EXTRACTION EXAMPLE ✓
```
Field: Patient Name
Document shows: "SMITH, JOHN A" printed clearly in Box 2
```
Response:
```json
{
  "patient_name": {
    "value": "SMITH, JOHN A",
    "confidence": 0.95,
    "location": "Box 2, top-left section",
    "bbox": {"x": 0.05, "y": 0.12, "w": 0.30, "h": 0.03}
  }
}
```
Why this is correct: Value exactly matches what's visible, high confidence is justified,
bbox pinpoints the exact region in the document.

### GOOD NULL EXAMPLE ✓
```
Field: Date of Birth
Document shows: Box 3 has handwriting that's partially smudged, looks like "0?/15/19?8"
```
Response:
```json
{
  "date_of_birth": {
    "value": null,
    "confidence": 0.0,
    "location": "Box 3 - text smudged, cannot read reliably"
  }
}
```
Why this is correct: Uncertain characters → return null rather than guess.
Note: bbox is omitted when value is null (no region to ground).

### BAD EXTRACTION EXAMPLE ✗
```
Field: Total Charges
Document shows: Line items but total box is empty
```
BAD Response (DO NOT DO THIS):
```json
{
  "total_charges": {
    "value": "$1,234.56",
    "confidence": 0.8,
    "location": "Calculated from line items"
  }
}
```
Why this is WRONG: Value was calculated/inferred, not read from document.

CORRECT Response:
```json
{
  "total_charges": {
    "value": null,
    "confidence": 0.0,
    "location": "Total box is empty"
  }
}
```

### BAD PLACEHOLDER EXAMPLE ✗
```
Field: Provider NPI
Document shows: NPI field is blank
```
BAD Response (DO NOT DO THIS):
```json
{
  "provider_npi": {
    "value": "1234567890",
    "confidence": 0.7,
    "location": "Assumed standard format"
  }
}
```
Why this is WRONG: Value was made up using typical pattern.

CORRECT Response:
```json
{
  "provider_npi": {
    "value": null,
    "confidence": 0.0,
    "location": "NPI field is blank"
  }
}
```
"""


# Constitutional AI-style critique prompt
CONSTITUTIONAL_CRITIQUE = """
## SELF-CRITIQUE PROTOCOL

After generating your extraction, mentally review it as a skeptical auditor:

### Critique Questions:
1. "Is this value actually visible, or am I filling in what I expect to see?"
2. "Would another person reading this document arrive at the same value?"
3. "Am I being overconfident? Should any of my 0.9+ scores actually be lower?"
4. "Did I return null for anything that was unclear, or did I rationalize a guess?"
5. "Are there any suspiciously 'perfect' values that might be hallucinations?"

### If You Catch an Error:
- Revise the extraction before responding
- Lower confidence scores where appropriate
- Change uncertain values to null
- Add notes explaining any ambiguity
