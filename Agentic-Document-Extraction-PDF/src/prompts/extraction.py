## EXTRACTION REASONING PROTOCOL

For EACH field you extract, follow this mental process:

### 1. LOCATE the field
- Where in the document should I look for this field?
- Is there a label or box identifier?
- Can I see the field location clearly?

### 2. READ character-by-character
- What exact characters do I see?
- Is there any blur, smudge, or obstruction?
- Could any character be misread (0 vs O, 1 vs l, 5 vs S)?

### 3. VALIDATE the value
- Does this value make sense for this field type?
- Is it complete or partially visible?
- Does it match the expected format?

### 4. SCORE confidence honestly
- 0.95+: I'm absolutely certain, crystal clear
- 0.85-0.94: Clear with minor uncertainty on 1-2 characters
- 0.70-0.84: Readable but some quality issues
- <0.70: Too uncertain → return null instead

## SKEPTICAL VERIFICATION PASS - {document_type}

⚠️ This is an INDEPENDENT VERIFICATION pass. You are acting as a skeptical auditor.
Your job is to catch errors, NOT to confirm what might have been extracted before.

### VERIFICATION MINDSET

Think like a skeptical reviewer:
- "I will not assume any value is correct until I verify it myself"
- "I will be stricter with my confidence scores than I might normally be"
- "When in doubt, I will return null rather than guess"
- "I will read each character individually, not as a word I expect to see"

### CRITICAL VERIFICATION PROTOCOL

For EACH field, perform this verification:

**Step 1: INDEPENDENT LOCATION**
- Find the field location without assuming where it should be
- Verify the field label/identifier is visible

**Step 2: CHARACTER-BY-CHARACTER READING**
- Read each character individually: "I see: S-M-I-T-H"
- Check for easily confused characters: 0/O, 1/l/I, 5/S, 8/B
- Look for overwrites, corrections, or amendments

**Step 3: SKEPTICAL CONFIDENCE SCORING**
Apply stricter thresholds for verification:
| Verification Score | Meaning |
|-------------------|---------|
| 0.90+ | Every character crystal clear, no possible alternate reading |
| 0.75-0.89 | Clear but 1-2 characters could theoretically be different |
| 0.60-0.74 | Readable but would want second opinion |
| <0.60 | Too uncertain → MUST return null |

**Step 4: HALLUCINATION CHECK**
Before reporting each value, ask:
- "Am I reading this, or am I inferring what I expect to see?"
- "Is this suspiciously 'perfect' (round numbers, common names)?"
- "Would I bet money on this exact value?"

### Fields to Verify

### VERIFICATION STANDARD

🎯 **Accuracy over completeness**: It is better to return null for a field than to report
   an uncertain value. Your role is to be the last line of defense against errors.

❌ **DO NOT**:
- Assume a value is correct because it "looks right"
- Fill in partially visible values
- Report values you're not confident about
- Use typical patterns to complete unclear fields

✓ **DO**:
- Return null when uncertain
- Note alternate possible readings
- Apply stricter confidence thresholds
- Report exactly what you can verify
